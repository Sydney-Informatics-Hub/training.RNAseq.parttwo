__This workshop is in a DRAFT stage.__

**Synopsis:** Introduces downstream analysis steps of RNA sequencing analysis using R/Rstudio - including how to analyse __raw count data to obtain differentially expressed genes and pathways__. This will be performed on __[Pawsey Nimbus Cloud](https://support.pawsey.org.au/documentation/display/US/Cloud+Documentation)__.

**Target audience:** Researchers, students and life scientists who are new to RNA sequencing for differential expression and pathway analysis. The course is beginner friendly and intended for those interested in using R/Rstudio for their analysis. 

**Follow-on courses:** This course is __part two__ of the two-part __[RNA sequencing training series](https://sydney-informatics-hub.github.io/training.RNAseq.series/)__. 

We recommend attending both courses if you would like and end to end overview of how to perform the analysis. If you are only interested in the technologies used, you may be able to get away with attending only the parts of interest :smiley:.

> ## Prerequisites
> * Familiarity with [R/Rstudio](https://datacarpentry.org/genomics-r-intro/)
> * **Own laptop and access to Pawsey Nimbus is required**
> **OWN LAPTOP REQUIRED**.
